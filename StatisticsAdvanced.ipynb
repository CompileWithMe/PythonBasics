        "**Uncertainty Representation:**\n",
        "A confidence interval expresses the uncertainty inherent in any sample-based estimate. It helps show that while we can estimate a population parameter (like the mean), we cannot be certain of its exact value. The interval provides a range where the true value is expected to lie.\n",

        "**Confidence Level:**\n",
        "The confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%) indicates the probability that the interval will contain the true parameter if you were to repeat the sampling process many times. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that if you took 100 samples, approximately 95 of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.\n",

        "Comparing Different Distributions\n",
        "Suppose you have two different distributions‚Äîone representing test scores in a class, and another representing heights in a population. Each distribution has its own mean and standard deviation, but you can use Z-scores to compare a particular test score and a height by converting them both into Z-scores.\n",
        "\n",
        " Identifying Relative Position\n",
        "Z-scores allow you to identify where a specific value stands in relation to its own distribution and how it compares across different distributions. For instance, a Z-score of +2 indicates a value is two standard deviations above the mean, which might be considered an outlier in one distribution but not in another.\n",
        "\n",
        "This comparison helps in benchmarking or understanding relative performance across different datasets or populations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Standard Normal Distribution\n",
        "Z-scores are often compared to the standard normal distribution (a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1). If data from different distributions are transformed into Z-scores, you can compare them to the standard normal distribution and even use Z-tables to calculate probabilities and percentiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If you want to compare a test score from one class to a test score from another class (with different means and standard deviations), Z-scores give you a way to standardize both scores and see which one is \"better\" relative to its distribution.\n",

        "\n",
        "The assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Independence: The observations in the sample must be independent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random Sampling: The sample should be randomly selected from the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sample Size: The sample size should be large enough (typically n ‚â• 30, though larger for highly skewed distributions).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finite Variance: The population must have a finite variance (i.e., a finite standard deviation).\n",
        "\n",
        "These assumptions ensure that the distribution of sample means will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the original population's shape.\n",

        "##22). What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "The expected value in a probability distribution is the average or mean outcome you would expect from a random process, calculated by summing the possible outcomes weighted by their probabilities. It represents the center or typical value of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "##23). How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "A probability distribution describes all possible outcomes of a random variable and their associated probabilities. The expected outcome (or expected value) is the weighted average of all possible outcomes, with each outcome weighted by its probability. In other words, the expected value is the \"center\" or average value that you would expect to see, based on the probability distribution, over many repetitions of the random process.\n"
