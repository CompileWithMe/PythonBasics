        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. It allows developers to structure code in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions.\n",
        "OOPs is based on four fundamental principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "1: Encapsulation\n",
        "- Wrapping data(variables) and methods(functions) into a single unit called a class.\n",
        "- Prevents direct access to some parts of an object and only exposes necessary information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2: Abstraction\n",
        "- Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features.\n",
        "- Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "3: Inheritance\n",
        "- Allows a class(child) to inherit properties and behavior from another class(parent).\n",
        "- Promotes resuability and reduces code duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "4: Polymorphism\n",
        "- Allows a single function or method to have multiple implementations.\n",
        "-Achieved through method overloading(same method name, different parameters) and method ovverriding(redefining a method in a subclass).\n",
